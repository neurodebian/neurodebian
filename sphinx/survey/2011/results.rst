Submitter background
--------------------

The figures in this section provide some information on the background of the
participants in this survey: What data do they work with? Where are they coming
from? What is their position? Whom are they employed by?

Scientific computing environment preferences
--------------------------------------------

This figures in this section expand the analysis on operating system environment
preference, and illustrate the results of the rating analysis reported in the
paper.

Rating analyses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The figures in this section show rating statistics grouped by the
respective operating system and use the same system color code
as in the figure above. The segments in each bar indicate the
frequency of individual rating options (from *definitely disagree* to
*definitely agree*) in up to four levels of color saturation.
